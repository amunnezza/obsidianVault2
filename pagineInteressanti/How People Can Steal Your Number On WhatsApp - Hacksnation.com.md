A new method has been used to steal unprotected numbers from WhatsApp users. This is a method to call the voice mailbox to receive the code after you called the victim through a verification code from WhatsApp.

If the victim denies the call or does not respond the code is laying on the mailbox as far as the victim has one enabled.

The attacker is simply calling the number with either an unknown caller id or something like that and if the victim does not reply voicemail is answering.

Then the attacker tries different MMI codes which are in this case \*1234#,\*0000#, or \*1111# to access the voicemail through dial pad.

After the attacker listened to the WhatsApp voice mail, he’s able to connect to your WhatsApp account…

We aren’t leakerhounds if we only show the attack!

Here is, how you’ll protect yourself from this attack:

The best way to protect yourself from these attacks is, to disable your voicemail if you are not using it.

To disable voicemails you go to your dial pad and call :

Android: ##002#

iPhone : #004# or ##002#

If you want to use your voicemail, change the password of the voicemail. There are a lot of internet tutorials to do that so we don’t go deeper into that topic.

After that enable 2FA on your WhatsApp account. Once the attacker has access to your account he could enable 2FA and you were not able to recover your account again unless you prove to WhatsApp that you’re the real SIM card owner by phone bills!

Here is a tutorial from WhatsApp:
