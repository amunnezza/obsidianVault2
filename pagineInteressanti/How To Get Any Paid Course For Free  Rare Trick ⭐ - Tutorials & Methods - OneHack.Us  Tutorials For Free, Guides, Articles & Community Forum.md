1.  I typed the name of the course on Google, scrolled down, pressed “Complaint” and it redirected me to this website called Lumen.

-   After analyzing the website for a little bit I discovered that it contains all the copyright claims on Google.
    
-   You might be wondering, “How can the copyright claims help me get any course in the world for free?”.
    
-   Well, authors try to delete their courses from any websites that let people download them for free.
    
-   They do that through copyright claims.
    
-   Finding all the copyright claims naturally means that you find all websites with the course.
    
-   Go to [lumendatabase.org 174](http://lumendatabase.org/) and search for the name of your course.
    
-   This will show you all the copyright claims.
    
-   The claims contain all the websites with the course.
    
-   Search the course on every website till you find the one that lets you download it for free.
    
-   THIS WORKS WITH ANY COURSE AND IT’S 100% FREE & FAST!!!
    
-   It changed my life and I know it will change yours ![:slight_smile:](https://onehack.us/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")
    
-   Enjoy!
