[https://www.isc2.org/uploadedFiles/Certification\_Programs/CBT-Examination-Agreement.pdf](https://www.isc2.org/uploadedFiles/Certification_Programs/CBT-Examination-Agreement.pdf)

Candidates that do not agree to the terms and conditions will not be permitted to sit for any (ISC)² examination.

Forfeiture of exam appointment also includes forfeiture of all exam fees. To take the examination at a later date you will be required to re-register for the exam and pay all applicable registration fees.

**Important Information on (ISC)² Exams**

-   One of the benefits to candidates taking an examination via Computer-Based Testing is that most candidates receive their scores immediately upon completing their examination. In some cases, (ISC)² must conduct periodic psychometric analyses prior to releasing exam results. For the small number of candidates affected by this process, it is expected that candidates will receive their results within 6 -8 weeks following the exam.
-   (ISC)² offers two types of computer-based exams – linear and adaptive – however neither exam type allows for candidates to skip an item, nor can items be returned to later during administration. Once an answer is confirmed it cannot be changed, reviewed, or revisited.
-   Frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers for common inquiries that can be found here:

[https://www.isc2.org/Frequently-Asked-Questions](https://www.isc2.org/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

**Accommodations Policy**

(ISC)² provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations for people who have a documented need for exam accommodations. Accommodations must be requested and approved by (ISC)² prior to scheduling your examination. If you wish to request an accommodation, please visit [https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam](https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam) and look under the Requesting Special Accommodations tab for information and instructions on how to request an accommodation. Test accommodations are individualized and considered on a case-by-case basis. Once an accommodation is approved, (ISC)² will inform the Pearson VUE Accommodations team. Please allow up to three business days for Pearson VUE to receive this information. Then, contact Pearson VUE, so you can schedule your exam, contact information can be found at [www.pearsonvue.com/isc2/contact](http://www.pearsonvue.com/isc2/contact).

Accommodations are not a guarantee of improved performance or exam completion. Once an initial exam appointment is scheduled, there may be a U.S. $50 USD fee to reschedule an exam with an approved accommodation.
