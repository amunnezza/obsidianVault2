# 63 Cybersecurity Resources for Any Stage of Your Career

> ## Excerpt
> This list of free cybersecurity resources, courses, and others tools will help newcomers and current professionals stay informed, sharp, and secure.

---
The field of cybersecurity is always evolving, and nothing suggests that that is likely to change soon. That’s because hackers are constantly finding new ways to infiltrate systems. A degree or bootcamp will give you the foundational knowledge you’ll need to launch your career, but cybersecurity professionals need to be constantly learning once they’re out of school. 

Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or just getting started in your cybersecurity career, it’s important to stay up to date on the newest developments. That’s why we’ve put together this list of sixty-three cybersecurity resources, including cybersecurity experts to follow, blogs to read, podcasts to listen to, and channels to watch. With these resources, you’ll be one step ahead of other cybersecurity professionals, and hopefully one step ahead of the hackers too.
