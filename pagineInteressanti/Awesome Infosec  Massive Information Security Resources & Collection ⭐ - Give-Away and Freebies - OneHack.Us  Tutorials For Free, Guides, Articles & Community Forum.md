This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange. Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.

The primary incentive for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability, or series of vulnerabilities is to achieve a return on an investment (his/her time usually). This return need not be strictly monetary, an attacker may be interested in obtaining access to data, identities, or some other commodity that is valuable to them. The field of penetration testing involves authorized auditing and exploitation of systems to assess actual system security in order to protect against attackers. This requires thorough knowledge of vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. Thus, this course provides an introductory but comprehensive coverage of the fundamental methodologies, skills, legal issues, and tools used in white hat penetration testing and secure system administration.

We all learn in different ways: in a group, by yourself, reading books, watching/listening to other people, making notes or things out for yourself. Learning the basics & understanding them is essential; this knowledge can be enforced by then putting it into practice.

Over the years people have been creating these resources and a lot of time has been put into them, creating ‘hidden gems’ of training material. However, unless you know of them, its hard to discover them.

So VulnHub was born to cover as many as possible, creating a catalogue of ‘stuff’ that is (legally) ‘breakable, hackable & exploitable’ - allowing you to learn in a safe environment and practice ‘stuff’ out. When something is added to VulnHub’s database it will be indexed as best as possible, to try and give you the best match possible for what you’re wishing to learn or experiment with.

This book is about constructing practical cruptosystems for which we can argue security under plausible assumptions. The book covers many constructions for different tasks in cryptography. For each task we define the required goal. To analyze the constructions, we develop a unified framework for doing cryptographic proofs. A reader who masters this framework will capable of applying it to new constructions that may not be covered in this book. We describe common mistakes to avoid as well as attacks on real-world systems that illustratre the importance of rigor in cryptography. We end every chapter with a fund application that applies the ideas in the chapter in some unexpected way.
