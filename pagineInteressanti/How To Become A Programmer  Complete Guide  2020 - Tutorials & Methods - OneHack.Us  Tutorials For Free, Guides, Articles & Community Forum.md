Computer programmer plays a very important role in making Applications, Games, Operating Systems, etc related to the Software and nowadays tech companies are hiring skilled programmers to improve the technology.

Becoming a computer programmer open lots of opportunity in the Job field such as Software Engineer, Programmer, Data Scientist, Web-Developer, Project Manager, etc.

Since programming is a trendy and futuristic topic nowadays that’s why most people want to explore this field and want to know how to become a programmer?.

So I wrote this article especially for those peoples who really want to become a programmer.

But wait, before going to the actual topic, there are some terms like **what is programming? and coding?** , **What is a programming language?** that should be cleared out.

**After clearing the above terms we will understand:**

-   What does a computer programmer do?
-   How to become a programmer?
-   Which programming language is suitable for you?
-   What are the opportunities for programmers?

### What Is Programming & Coding?

Lots of programmers confused between two terms: Programming and Coding.

Defining a solution to a problem (with all details) is called **Programming** whereas writing codes (with the help of all details) in one or more than one programming language is called **coding** .

There are some more topics in programming like **functional programming** , **competitive programming** , etc which we will cover later.

### What Is A Programming Language?

Since our modern digital devices such as computers, mobile phones, printers, etc which understand the only machine language which is 0,1, It becomes too much hard to write a program in machine language that’s why computer scientists designed the programming language.

Unlike any other language, A **programming** **language** is a high-level language that is used to communicate with the machine level language. We write the source code in various programming languages that are compiled or interpreted into machine language.

Every programming languages have some pre-defined syntaxes such as Identifier, Data-types, which is the basic building block of a programming language.

There are multiples programming languages for various purposes but they have categorized in mainly two parts **Compiled programming language** (such as C language) and **Interpreted programming language** (Java, Python, C#, C++, etc).

**Now we’ve cleared the terms that you should know before becoming a computer programmer. The next terms are more important:**

### What Does A Computer Programmer Do?

A computer programmer does software/apps building, games building, web-designing by writing, testing and debugging the thousands of lines of codes.

There are several types of programmer in computer programmer’s fields but mainly there are three types of programmers:

1.  **Front-end developer**
2.  **Back-end developer**
3.  **Full-stack developer**

**Front-end developers** mainly interact with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery to develop the websites. How a website looks (including layout, header, colors, sidebar, etc) from the front/user side is managed by front-end programmers. Whereas **Back-end developers** interact with server-side programming using C++, Java, Python, etc programming languages.  
And the combination of both front-end and back-end developers is called **Full-stack developers** .

### How To Become A Programmer?

Since this is our main section of the article it’s going to be a little long, don’t worry it’s not going to be boring.

Being a programmer is a hot job nowadays but at the learning phase, you can face difficulties that’s why it’s better to take advice and some tips and tricks to become a good programmer without facing lots of difficulties.  
I’m adding some steps to become a programmer in an easy way

#### Choose A Programming Language According To Your Goal

I said, choose a programming language according to your goal. It means at the first step you’ve to choose your goal among front-end, back-end or full-stack developers. If your goal is to become a web developer, you’ve to learn HTML, CSS, JavaSript, Jquery.

But in case if your goal is to build apps/games, you may be confused between multiple programming languages like Java, Python, C#, swift but I would suggest you learn C# for desktop app building and choose Java to build android apps.

**Note:-**

1.  Never learn multiple programming languages at once.
2.  Stick with one programming language. Otherwise, you will be frustrated.

#### Don’t Skip The Basic

I’ve seen many beginner programmers who have skipped the basics of a programming language like functions and it’s type, how to call a function, data types, etc and they faced much trouble to create even a simple program. That’s why I am telling you don’t skip the building blocks of a programming language.

#### Practice A Lot!

This section is very important to learn a programming language completely from scratch. Practice! Practice! and more Practice! will make you a better programmer one day. Do at least 4-8 hours of coding in a day to master a programming language within a certain period.

Don’t be sad when you get an error, always play with errors because once you are familiar with all types of errors it will be a lot more helpful while debugging.

#### Do Projects

You can find too many projects for yourself from [Google 26](https://google.com/). Start from basic projects like building a simple snake, tic-tac-toe games, etc. Once you’re done with basic projects, do some harder projects like participating in open source projects.

#### Participate In Coding Bootcamps Or Online Coding Exams

Always participate in coding boot camps, It will let you improve your coding skills as well check your own coding skills. If somehow you’re unable to participate in coding boot camps, use [Coderbyte 31](https://www.coderbyte.com/), [Topcoder 14](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/?pageIndex=1), [HackerRank 21](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), websites. These websites provide an online coding facility in free that is really awesome for beginners.

### What Are The Opportunities For Programmers?

Once you’ve learned a programming language, it opens lots of opportunities, jobs, offers for you. Read this article to know more.

**These are some great jobs for a computer programmer**

-   Software Application Developer
-   Web developer
-   Computer programmer
-   Technical program manager
-   Hacking (for this you’ve read some more)
-   Android/iOS app developer
-   Data scientist

If you are not getting jobs after learning a programming language, I would suggest you improve yourself by learning it more. You will definitely get success one day.

_In case you don’t want to do a job, A programmer can earn money online without a job._  
_these are-_

-   **Design template for websites:** You can design and create templates as a front-end programmer and sell it online at your own price.
-   **Open a Youtube channel:** Open a Youtube channel and share the knowledge and experience.
-   **Through a website**
-   **Open a Coaching center:** Open coaching and teach students offline.
-   **Participate in coding contests,** etc.

## ENJOY & HAPPY LEARNING! ![:+1:](https://onehack.us/images/emoji/apple/+1.png?v=9 ":+1:")
