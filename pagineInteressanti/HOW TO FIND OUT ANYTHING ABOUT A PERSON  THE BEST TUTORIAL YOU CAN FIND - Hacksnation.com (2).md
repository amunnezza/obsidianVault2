\[1\] Register on postman.com and create a new project  
\[2\] Open the project and press import, select link and paste there [https://www.postman.com/collections/f347…c34fb42a59](https://www.postman.com/collections/f3470ae065c34fb42a59)  
\[3\] After importing, check the “Collections” tab and open the imported project and select headers

To use the script, you must be “logged in” with Facebook. To do this, you need to copy some data from the browser window from which you are logged into your Facebook account. Use the Socpappet for this in case Facebook decides to block the account.

\[4\] Go to facebook.com. Open Browser Developer Tools (F12) and go to the Networking tab. Refresh the page, then select the GET request in network tools. Find the request headers and copy the entire cookie value and paste it on the postman site in the headers tab instead of <insert\_cookie\_here>  
\[5\] Open the view-source in a browser: [https://www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/) Press Ctrl + F and find the fb\_dtsg value. There should be only one search result, and a little to the right of the result there will be text containing value = with additional text in quotes. Copy this text in quotes and paste in the body tab instead of <insert\_dtsg\_value\_here>  
\[6\] Just below replace <user\_id> with your target’s Facebook account ID  
\[7\] Click Send and wait for a response

Format the resulting text for readability by clicking the button labeled “Text” and choosing “JSON” from the drop-down list. It will highlight the text and split it vertically.
