Heard of Upcycling/Freecycling???…. It’s where people drop books, music, and movie DVDs and you can pick it up for free. This is not like a library where you need to pay membership and return books back. This is completely free - people who had finished reading books, drop it for someone to grab it. It’s not exactly donation or charity,, you don’t even know or care who grabs the one you dropped.

Freecycling happens at Besant Nagar on Car-free Sundays between 6.30 am to 8.30 am at beach road, Chennai. I used to go there before the pandemic. You get good quality books of all varieties - kids books, novels, academic, non-fiction, management, magazines in Tamil, English, Hindi, etc.

Madras literary society will announce priorly about this event so that you pack your books to “give off”. There is no commitment - you can give off and walk away without taking any books, similarly, you can also take books without dropping off anything.

The idea is to build a society filled with literacy.

Original question - Where can I read some educational books for free?

Google Dorking can be used for several different things, but essentially it boils down to using advanced ‘search operators’ that Google allows when utilizing their Search feature. Yes, they can be used for Hacking, but in the realm of finding sites that are vulnerable (you still need to know how to do the actual hacking) but they are also great for finding actual information, music, movies, file types, etc. Here are some examples:

```
intitle: index.of +?last modified? +?parent directory? +pdf "lord of the rings" -htm -html -php -asp 
```

  
The above Search String is saying that you are looking for a .PDF file called Lord of the Rings and that you don’t want any results with the extensions or page types, including .htm, .html, .php, or .asp.

[Here is a link to a .PDF](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-05/BH_EU_05-Long.pdf "www.blackhat.com") that can give you much more information in regards to what operators are best used for certain situations.

I hope this helps!

There’s an ongoing battle over access to information on one side, and on the other people who don’t care how much damage they do or who they have to steal from if they can make a nickel.

You can tell from that where I stand. Publicly funded research is not the property of the people publishing the journal. You can’t steal all the water from a river that runs across your land, and you don’t own ideas you didn’t generate, even if you printed them.

Some illegal activity is reprehensible, other types is a counterbalance to socially acceptable but loathsome theft. God help us if we all start obeying laws just because they’re laws, or if we listen to people who talk as though a law made by stupid men to protect evil is in some way right.

There are people who would lock away all knowledge and charge for access. They’re currently doing well at this. You shouldn’t put up with this. Libgen is taking up a fight you can’t be bothered with, and I think that’s admirable.

My favorite free book website hands down is Z Library. No registration or card required! Any site that requires a card is probably a scam.

I believe that academic publishing should go through a revolution. It's just illogical to me that I can't lookup any knowledge that exists in academic circles freely through the internet and instead have this physical (superficial?) constraint of having to walk into an open university library. Why have this limitation? This looks more of a logistical problem then anything else to me.
