After reading over 200 self-improvement books over the past thirty years I have determined all self-improvement and success come down to three keystone lessons that all other principles rest upon.

## What are the 5 keys to success?

1.  **Mindset determines your success.**
2.  **Goals create the map to your success.** 
3.  **Modeling shows what leads to success.** 
4.  **Systems create the path to your success.** 
5.  **Perseverance makes you successful.**

### 1\. Mindset Determines Your Success

Do you know that your mindset plays a significant role in determining your success? Your mindset is the way you think, perceive, and approach things. It’s like the foundation of a building. A strong foundation can support a building, but a positive and growth-oriented mindset can support your success.

For example, imagine you have to give a speech in front of a large audience and have two mindsets to choose from: a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. If you have a fixed mindset, you might think, “I’m not good at public speaking, and I’ll probably mess up.” On the other hand, if you have a growth mindset, you might think, “I may not be good at public speaking yet, but I can learn and improve with practice.”

A positive mindset is vital to success because it helps you overcome challenges, learn from mistakes, and develop new skills. For example, a positive mindset allows you to see failure as an opportunity for growth rather than a roadblock to success, increasing your resilience and determination to achieve your goals.

A growth mindset can help you overcome challenges, learn from mistakes, and develop new skills. So, to achieve success, start by developing a positive and growth-oriented mindset.

Your mental model of the world will determine your belief system, attitude, and what you think is possible. A growth mindset is the proper mental perspective for success. This is the first step on the wrong to self-improvement. Get your mind right to start your journey.

### 2\. Goals Create the Map to Your Success

Setting goals is like creating a map for success. It gives you direction, focus, and motivation to achieve what you want. Goals can be short-term or long-term and can relate to any area of your life, such as academic, health, personal, relationships, or career.

For instance, suppose you want to improve your business. Setting a specific goal, such as getting more sales next month and making higher profits, can help you stay motivated and focused. It can also help you measure your progress and identify areas to improve.

Remember, setting realistic and achievable goals is essential. It’s better to set small, achievable goals than unrealistic ones that can discourage you. So, to create a map to your success, start by setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals on different time frames.

On the micro level, it can be goals for how much you want to earn a month, how much you want to weigh, or how much money you want to save. Look at achievable goals for your next steps in life and where you want to be next month or next year.

On the macro level, imagine your ideal life, and dream about what you would do if you could do anything for a living. What would be your ideal lifestyle? This is where you create the most inspiring goals, even if you don’t know how you will ever achieve them. Make them about your deepest desires and things you are passionate about. Don’t focus on things; focus on freedom, happiness, and doing what you love.

Your micro goals tell you what to work towards each day. Your macro goals can give you the energy to work to reach those rewards.

### **3\. Modeling shows what leads to success.** 

Modeling the success of others can be a powerful tool for quantifying what leads to achieving your goals. By analyzing the behaviors, strategies, and habits of successful people in your industry or field, you can identify patterns and best practices to apply to your work.

For example, suppose you are a business person who wants to improve your sales performance. By analyzing the sales strategies of successful salespeople in your industry, you may find that they use a specific approach to prospecting, making cold calls, or delivering presentations that you could adopt or adapt to your style. You may also find that successful salespeople have developed strong relationships with their clients or have a particular approach to handling objections that you could learn from and apply in your work.

By modeling the success of others, you can quantify the behaviors, strategies, and habits that lead to success and develop a systematic roadmap for achieving your goals. It’s important to remember that while modeling the success of others can be helpful, it’s also essential to remain true to your style, personality, and values. You should adapt your learning to fit your unique situation and experiment to find what works best.

If you want to be successful at something, first find a person or business that has already achieved your goals and study them. Quantify the metrics that made them successful, then incorporate them into the context of your systematic process. Find the underlying principles of success.

### 4\. Systems Create the Path to Your Success

Setting goals is not enough to achieve success. You also need a system to achieve them. A system is a set of processes, routines, and habits that help you achieve your goals consistently and efficiently.

For example, suppose you want to improve your writing skills. A system to achieve this goal could be to read daily, write for 30 minutes daily, and get feedback from a writing mentor or friend every week. This system will help you build your writing skills consistently and efficiently over time. You focus on your systems and your progress, and the results take care of themselves over time.

Remember, the system you create should be tailored to your goals and your personality. It should be something you can stick to consistently, and that helps you achieve your goals efficiently.

You can have the right mindset and focus on the right goals, but if you don’t have a quantified system to achieve your goals, then you will unlikely achieve them. Having a system with an edge is what most people lack that helps them overcome competition; this lack of process is why most people never get past the positive psychology phase of self-help and achieve anything substantial.

### 5\. Perseverance Makes You Successful

Perseverance is the ability to keep going even when things get tough. It’s like a muscle that you can develop and strengthen over time. Perseverance is essential for success because it helps you overcome obstacles, learn from failures, and achieve your goals. Grit is the ability not to give up until you reach your goals.

For instance, suppose you have been practicing guitar for six months and still can’t play your favorite song. Perseverance means continuing to practice, even when it’s frustrating and challenging. It means learning from your mistakes and repeatedly trying until you succeed. Now failing could be a message that you must hire a guitar teacher. Practice and perseverance are not enough; you must learn the proper form, method, and system to learn a skill. Doing something the wrong way for a long time achieves nothing but practicing doing it the wrong way.

The ego holds many back because they don’t want to humble themselves by accepting they have a beginner’s mind and must have a teacher. You must learn the right thing to do to achieve your goals first, and then you must master that skill through practice and perseverance. Incorporate proper action into a system that moves you closer to your goals over time. This is the way to success.

Remember, success is not just about talent or luck. It’s also about perseverance. If you want to be successful, develop the habit of perseverance. Learn from your mistakes, keep going even when things get tough, and never give up on your goals.

### How do you achieve success in life?

To succeed in life, you must develop a positive and growth-oriented mindset that allows you to overcome challenges and learn from your mistakes. You should set realistic and achievable goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. You must create a system of processes, routines, and habits that help you consistently and efficiently move closer to achieving your goals. Finally, you must cultivate the habit of perseverance, which enables you to keep going even when things get tough and never give up on your goals. This is what 200 self-help books will teach you.
