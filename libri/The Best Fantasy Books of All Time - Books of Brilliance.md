### Old and New Fantasy Books

Some of our picks are obvious and to be honest, this list was easier to make than the other ones. That is partly because I love fantasy novels and avidly have scoured dozens of lists over the years. It is no surprise to see The Lord of the Rings, A Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter on the list.

I would rather talk about less mainstream books like The Blade Itself, [Mistborn](https://booksofbrilliance.com/2022/09/04/mistborn-the-final-empire/), Gideon the Ninth, and [Six of Crows](https://booksofbrilliance.com/2022/09/17/book-review-six-of-crows/). Those are some of my favorite books of all time and each of them has its own spin on the fantasy genre. Gideon the Ninth is a witty sci-fi fantasy novel and it pushes the genre is a direction unlike any other book.

Lastly, what I noticed when making this list is that unlike other lists, the fantasy list includes a lot more recent books. The 2000’s seems to be a great decade for fantasy books and a lot of [authors](https://booksofbrilliance.com/2022/11/06/neil-gaiman-author-profile/) made a name for themselves. And there are still amazing books being released in this genre and that is a great sign for fans of fantasy.
